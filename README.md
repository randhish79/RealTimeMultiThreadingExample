## Real Time Multi Threading Example

We have two methods Wash() and Dry() which must be run in sequence in multi-threading . Dry() should only be run after Wash() method has been Finished. How can we write a shared method code in Multi-threading in Java to ensure Dry() is getting called only after Wash() of a car is finished.
